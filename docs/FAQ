FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
**************************

WHY ISN'T THERE A WEB BASED CONFIG GUI?

OpenID-LDAP-PHP is, more or less, "security" software. That being the case, I 
find it essential that I do my best to ensure my users employ good security 
practices, and the bottom line is that web based config tools are not secure 
enough. You have to allow your web server write access to a config file, and 
you have to send your credentials "over the wire" in a non-secure way to 
perform the setup at all.


WHY IS GMP NOT ON BY (OR EVEN USED BY) DEFAULT?

From the GMP home page (gmplib.org):

	GMP is very often miscompiled! We are seeing ever increasing
	problems with miscompilations of the GMP code. It has now come
	to the point where a compiler should be assumed to miscompile GMP.

That about says it all as far as I'm concerned. If you know you have a good GMP
library, you can switch it on.
